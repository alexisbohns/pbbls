-- purge_account: restore the connections deletes alongside achievement_unlocks
-- (#687)
-- =============================================================================
-- 20260730070347_mutual_connections.sql and 20260730090000_achievements.sql
-- were authored in parallel off the same base (20260729213348_pebble_drafts)
-- and each re-emitted purge_account with its own section-(4) append. Neither
-- saw the other. By timestamp the achievements copy applies last and wins, so
-- the merged history silently drops the three connections deletes.
--
-- Both bodies are otherwise byte-identical, so this re-emission is simply
-- their union: the connections trio from M49 plus achievement_unlocks from
-- M48. Nothing else changes. Grants are unchanged (service-role only, set in
-- 20260729201326); create or replace preserves them.
--
-- Neither migration had been applied to the linked project when this landed,
-- so no live database ever ran the regressed definition.
