-- purge_account: erase the Art. 9 consent ledger too (#775)
-- =============================================================================
-- user_consents.user_id references auth.users(id) with NO on-delete cascade
-- (deliberate: it matches profiles, so the purge stays explicit and the
-- zero-row assertion in verify-account-purge.ts stays meaningful). Without a
-- delete here, the delete-account edge function runs purge_account, sweeps
-- storage, and then fails at auth.admin.deleteUser with a 23503 on
-- user_consents_user_id_fkey for any user holding a consent row — all content
-- gone, auth row alive. Zero rows are affected today (no client writes consent
-- until Part 3), which is why this closes now rather than later.
--
-- The body below is copied VERBATIM from
-- 20260731090000_purge_account_union.sql with exactly one addition, at the
-- section-(4) `>>> APPEND ... HERE. <<<` marker. re-emitting this function is
-- how appends get lost: `create or replace` has no merge semantics and git
-- reports no conflict, so anything not carried forward is silently dropped
-- (that is the accident 20260731090000 exists to repair). The check is the
-- pairwise diff of the two function bodies — it must show additions only.
--
-- Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-art9-consent-gate-design.md §4.4.
-- Grants are unchanged (service-role only, set in 20260729201326);
-- create or replace preserves them.
